# Flappy Bird AI   
This repository contains a course project focused on training an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using reinforcement learning. The agent leverages the **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** algorithm to optimize its gameplay. The project is implemented using common Python libraries such as **PyTorch** for machine learning and **Pygame** for creating the game environment.

## Features  
- ðŸŽ® **Flappy Bird Game Environment**:  
  - A fully functional Flappy Bird game simulation.  
  - Includes the ability to play the game manually for comparison.  

- ðŸ¤– **AI Agent Training**:  
  - Implements the **Deep Q-Learning** algorithm to train the agent.  
  - Supports continuous learning through trial-and-error interactions with the environment.  
  - Supports saving and loading trained models for future use.

- ðŸ§ª **Testing and Evaluation**:  
  - Tools to test the agent's performance after training.  
  - Visualizes progress with performance metrics and graphs.
  - Ability to record the agent's learning and gameplay.

## Deep Q-Learning Algorithm Overview  
The Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm enables the AI agent to make decisions by approximating the Q-value function, which predicts the future reward for a given state-action pair.
